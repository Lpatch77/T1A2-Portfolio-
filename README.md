Purpose-

The initial purpose of this Portfolio is the showcase my skills and proficiency as a Web Developer to potential clients and employers. 

The secondary purpose I gather is to give us as students exposure to the processes and tools used in the workplace. 

Functionalty and features-

At this early stage I have chosen to base functionality on my limited knowledge and base the site on a basic menu/ submenu model using html and css.

Using links between four main pages with further links to sub pages and documents (resume) and external sites (LinkedIn)

I have as yet to include copy and have made use of Lorem Ipsum

Here is the site map-
